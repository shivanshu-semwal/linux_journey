* shell issue prompt and wait for you to enter command
* after a command is entered, the shell scans for the metacharacters and expands abbreviations 
* the shell waits for the command to execute

Types of shell:

* the C shell (/bin/csh) and its derivative, Tcsh (/bin/tcsh)

* `0-Standard Input` - The file (or stream) representing input, connected to the keyboard.
* `1-Standard Output` - The file (or stream) representing output, connected to the display.
* `2-Standard Error` - The file(or stream) representing error, connected to display.

Three standard file are represented by a number called file descriptor. 1,2,3.

* `<` - file redirection i.e. taking contents of one file as input
* `|` - pipe i.e. giving output of one command to another

Taking input from both file and standard input::
* `cat ~ foo`       #first from standard input and then from foo
* `cat foo ~ bar`   #first from foo, the stdin then bar

* `>` - redirecting output to a file
* `>>` - appending output to a file

File descriptors are implictily prefixed to the redirection symbols.
`e.g. > is same as 1>, < is same as <0.`

* `2>` - redirecting error stream
* `2>>` - appending error stream
