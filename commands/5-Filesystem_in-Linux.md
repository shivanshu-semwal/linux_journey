# Filesystem in Linux

Everything is file in linux.

* `ordinary file` - binary/text file
* `directory file` - contains filename and there inode number
* `device file`

* `pwd` - print workling directory

* `cd` - change directory
* `cd ~` - change to the home directory
* `cd -` - cahnge to previous directory(used for toggeling)

* `mkdir` - make directory
* `rmdir` - remove directory(empty directory)

* `ls` - list files 
    * Options and flags::
    * `-x` multicolumnar output
    * `-F` mark executables with *, directories with /, symbolic links with @
    * `-a` show all files
    * `-R` recursive list
    * `-r` sort in reverse
    * `-l` long listing
    * `-t` sort by last modification time
    * `-u` sort by last access time
    * `-i` display inode number

## handling text files


* `cat [filename]` - displays the contents of the file 
* `cat -v [filename]` - displays the non-graphical characters also
* `cat -n [filename]` - displays the line number also
* `cp [file] [destination]` - copy file to the destination
* `cp -i` - interactive copy(provides warning while overwriring)
* `cp -R` - recursive copy 
* `mv` - renames a files 
* `rm` - remove a file


## archiving and compressing

gzip to compress tar to archive and zip to archive and compress

### gzip and gnuzip (.gz)

* `gzip -d [filename]` - decompress the file
* `gzip -r [filename]` - recursive compression
* `gzip -l [filename]` - list the compression ratio

### tar - archival program (.tar file)

**tar**

* `-c` create an archive
* `-x` extract the archive
* `-t` view the archive
* `-x` extract the files form archive
* `-t` displays files in archive
* `-f` arch - specifies the archive arch
* `-v` verbose mode

`tar -cvf [archive name] [files to add...]`

### now to compress the file use gzip

`gzip [archive name]` - creates a tar-gzipped file

* `tar -xvf [archive name]` - extracts the archive
* `tar -tvf [archive name]` - view the archive

### Doing archiving and compression together (-z)

`tar -cvzf [compressed archive]` - create a compressed archive

### zip AND unzip - compressing and archiving together (.zip)

* `zip [archive name] [input files]` - creates an archive
* `zip -r [archive name]` - recursive compressing
* `unzip [archive name]` - unzips an archive
* `unzip -v [archive name]` - viewing detaill about the compressed file


## Basic File Attributes


`ls -l` - long listing files 
The columns are as folows::
* File Type and Permissions
* Links - the number of links associated with that particular file
* Ownership - owner of the file
* Group Ownership 
* File Size in bytes
* Last Modification Date
* Filename

File Ownership
* The user-id (UID) 
* The group-id (GID)

`id` - view UID and GID associated with particular user

## File Permissions

```
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
|d|r|w|x|r|w|x|r|w|x|
```

* `r` - read permission
* `w` - write permission
* `x` - execute permission

* `0` - defines the type of file d for directory, - for normal file
* `1,2,3` - permission granted to owner of file
* `4,5,6` - permission granted to group owner of file
* `7,8,9` - permission granted to other users

`chmod` - used to change the permissions of the file

`chmod [category][operation][permission] [filename...]`

* category - u-user, g-group, o-other, a-all(ugo)
* operation - + assign permission, - remove permission, = absolute permission
* permission - r, w, x

`chmod [ocatal-code] [filename...]` - used to assign absolute permission

```
        a        b        c
|0|  |4 2 1|  |4 2 1|  |4 2 1|
|d|  |r|w|x|  |r|w|x|  |r|w|x|
```

`octal-code` - a three digit code for permission of the file

How directory permission affect the file permissions:
* if the directory has write permission for all than they can delete the files in the directory

Changing file ownership

* `chown [options] [owner] [files...]` - change owner of file to owner
* `chgrp [group] [files...]` - change group of file to group
